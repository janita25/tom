          <p>Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown, food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground, 
often flavored, as with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient 
in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence 
of use traces to the Mokaya, with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact,
 the majority of Mesoamericanpeople made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage 
 known as xocolƒÅtl Nahuatl, a Nahuatl word meaning "bitter water".

<p> The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must befermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then 
ground tococoa mass, pure chocolate in rough form. Because the cocoa mass is usually liquefied before being molded with or 
without other ingredients, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be processed into two components: cocoa solids 
and cocoa butter. Unsweetened baking chocolate (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying
 proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter 
 or other fat, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate
 contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.</p>

<p>Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine and caffeine. Chocolate also contains 
anandamide. Chocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number of foodstuffs involving chocolate 
have been created, particularly desserts including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies 
are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate, and bars of solid chocolate and candy bars coated in chocolate are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes 
(e.g., eggs, hearts) have become traditional on certain Western holidays.
