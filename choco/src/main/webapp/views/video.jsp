			<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
				
				<p>Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food
					preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground, and often
					flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste,
					or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.
					Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three
					millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to
					the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate
					beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. Chocolate has become one of the
					most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number
					of foodstuffs involving chocolate have been created,particularly
					desserts including cakes, pudding, and
					chocolate chip cookies. Gifts of chocolate molded into different
					shapes (e.g., eggs, hearts) have become traditional on certain
					Western holidays, such as Easter and Valentine's Day.It's
					also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot
					chocolate and in some alcoholic drinks.</p>
